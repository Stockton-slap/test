UI/UX adjustments:
1. mobile is not adapted. i've added navigation, edited footer text, ideally would change text sizes everywhere, besides would replace emojis with svgs.
2. texts in cards randomly had text-align justify which made them look apart. I removed it.
3. according to what users usually get used to is that the logo should be clickable. 
4. fav icon is must have.
